. Description:

        Version 0.2.0

        Forked from unauthorized 0.1.4 version, using Github as
        repository: https://github.com/nohuhu/CGI-Test

        Removed all dependencies on Carp::Datum as it is long outdated
        and unsupported.

        Updated Makefile.PL to new format, with modules in lib/ and
        ChangeLog renamed to Changes.

        Updated dependencies to reflect the changes in CPAN module
        distribution. For one, HTTP::Status module was split from LWP
        along with several others in HTTP::Message bundle which
        requires Perl 5.8.8+ to build and it breaks CGI::Test build
        pattern. Now Makefile.PL will choose either LWP or HTTP::Message
        depending on Perl version.

        Added small feature: HTTP response headers are now stored in
        CGI::Test object and can be read with headers() method. Maybe
        it would be better to place them in CGI::Test::Page object but
        by CGI::Test logic Page represents an actual page not HTTP
        response.

        Updated code to be compatible with Perl 5.14.

        Added Pod testing script and fixed Pod errors it discovered.

        Test suite now runs successfully under Linux, Solaris and Darwin
        platforms; Perls 5.6.1 to 5.14.1 were used to run tests.

        Bumped version to clearly reflect changes.

. Description:

        Version 0.1.4.

        CGI::Test has changed ownership. The new owner is Steven Hilton
        <mshiltonj@mshiltonj.com>.  Many thanks to Raphael Manfredi
        and Steve Fink.

        CGI::Test is now hosted as a SourceForge project. It is located 
        at <http://cgi-test.sourceforge.net>.

        POD updated to reflect the above.

        make() method on various objects has been deprecated, and has been
        replaced by more conventional (for me, at least) new() method. 
        Support for make() may be removed in a later release.

        Entire codebase reformatted using perltidy
        Go to <http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/> to see how neat it is.

        Self-referential object variable name standardized to '$this'
        throughout code.

. Description:

        Version 0.1.3.

        Changed test 22 in t/browse.pl to perform explicit sorting
        of the month parameter string, so that the string comparison
        is reliable.

. Description:

        Version 0.1.2.

        Discard parameters when figuring out content-type, so that
        we build proper Page objects.

        Added note about possible parameters in content_type in
        the man page for CGI::Test::Page.

        Fixed t/parsing regression test so that it works even when there
        are parameters in the returned content-type field.

. Description:

        Version 0.1.1.

        Set PERL5LIB in child to mirror parent's @INC, so that the CGI
        program, if written in Perl, can get the same include path.

        Version 0.1.0.
        Initial public alpha relase.
